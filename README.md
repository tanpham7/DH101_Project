## Group Project Abstract
Looking into big data can prove to be useful for any scholars wanting to conduct bulk research through faster means. However, big data is an untapped field where only a minority have proper understanding and access to big data. As a group, we want to gain some insight on how big data works and the barriers that come with tryng to understand big data. The three readings we have selected are “Critical Questions for Big Data” by Dana Boyd and Kate Crawson, “The differences between Digital Humanities and Digital History” by Stephen Robertson, and “Against the Cultural Singularity” by Alvin Liu. With these readings, a introduction to big data can be established, some history and context of the field is provided, and further explanation with possible solutions can be inferred. Overall, although it was tough to meet and work as a group, we were able to accommplish our individual goals and tie everything together once we were able to all meet.


## Individual Project Abstract
Football, or soccer as Americans know it, is the most popular sport in the world. With this in mind, I wanted to look into the female side of the sport as women’s soccer continues to evolve to levels, popularity, and success akin to men’s soccer. As such, a huge demand for equal pay has been voiced by many female soccer players around the world. I want to see how women’s soccer has been doing in relation to the lucrative earnings men’s soccer has accumulated to determine the trajectory of their earnings and find out when women may be able to earn the same a men do. My research question looks into these earnings to ask what they might imply economically as the sport can be very profitable and if women will see a rise in pay anytime soon. My research was mostly limited to data on men as there is not an established database for women's salaries and statistics. However, as I looked into the popularity of both men's and women's soccer, there is a chance that women may see higher wages if attendance and viewership continue to increase. Some thoughts and questions I had for the future is if women players can have a database for their earnings as men do and if investment into making women's soccer more popular can be worth the costs.
